The floating license can be used on your personal computer when connected to the Bigelow network (on campus or VPN) and is located at geneious.bigelow.org. Once you have downloaded Geneious Prime ([https://www.geneious.com/download/](https://www.geneious.com/download/)) you can activate the license by selecting Help -> Activate License then select License Server and enter geneious.bigelow.org in the Server field and leave the Port field as is. Please close Geneious when you are done or release the license so that others can use it.
