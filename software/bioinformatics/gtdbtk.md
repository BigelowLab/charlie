## GTDBtk

GTDBtk is the command line software for classifying microbial genomes using [GTDB](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/).

It is installed in a conda environment called 'gtdbtk' under scgc's anaconda3/2019.07 module.  To load:

```
module use /mod/scgc/
module load anaconda3
source activate gtdbtk
```

The database for this software *should* be in the path once this env is loaded.  For future reference, it can be found here: ```/mnt/scgc/scgc_nfs/ref/gtdb/release95```.
