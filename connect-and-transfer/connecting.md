# Connecting to Charlie

### Connecting to Charlie

Open a terminal application (Mac: /Applications/Utilities/Terminal; Windows: Command Prompt or "Terminal")

Use ssh to securely log into the Charlie front end (cfe):\
`ssh username@cfe.bigelow.org`\
(this can be shortened to `ssh cfe` if your username on cfe is the same as on your computer and if you are using Bigelow's DNS server.)
